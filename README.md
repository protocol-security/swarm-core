N coding agents in Docker, coordinating through git.
No orchestrator, no message passing.  Designed to support
multiple agent CLIs via a driver abstraction layer.

Previously named `claude-swarm`. Existing installations do not need
new configuration or directory names; see
[upgrading existing installations](USAGE.md#upgrading-from-claude-swarm).

Based on the agent-team pattern from
[Building a C Compiler with Large Language Models](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- bash (5.0+), git, jq, bc
- tput (ncurses) — used by the dashboard
- Credentials for the selected [agent/provider](USAGE.md#auth-modes)

For development: `shellcheck` for linting.

## Setup

Add as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/protocol-security/swarm-core.git \
  tools/swarm-core
```

Or clone standalone and run from your project directory
(with a `swarm.json` in the project root):

```bash
./path/to/swarm-core/launch.sh start --dashboard
```

## How it works

```
Host                         /tmp (bare repos)
~/project/ ── git clone ──>  project-upstream.git (rw)
               --bare        project-mirror-*.git (ro)
                                        |
                                        | docker volumes
                                        |
                 .-----------.----------+-----------.
                 |           |          |           |
           Container 1            Container 2       ...
           /upstream  (rw)        /upstream  (rw)
           /mirrors/* (ro)        /mirrors/* (ro)
                 |                      |
                 v                      v
           /workspace/            /workspace/
           (agent-work)           (agent-work)
```

All containers mount the same bare repo. Each runs
`lib/harness.sh` which loops: reset to `origin/agent-work`,
run one agent session, push. When one agent pushes, others
see the changes on the next fetch.

Interactive containers use the same image and setup, but start a
human-guided driver UI or shell on a separate
`swarm/<run>/interactive-*` branch. `harvest.sh` merges those
branches explicitly alongside `agent-work`.

## Quick start

```bash
# Create a swarmfile and launch numbered agents.
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh start --dashboard

# Later, after agents are running or have exited:
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh wait

# Open a human-guided session from a named agent profile:
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh interactive hunter

# Or place swarm.json in your repo root and launch.
./launch.sh start --dashboard
```

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for all commands, dashboard keys,
and testing.

## Configuration

Place a `swarm.json` in your repo root:

```json
{
  "prompt": "prompts/task.md",
  "setup": "scripts/setup.sh",
  "max_idle": 3,
  "driver": "claude-code",
  "agents": [
    { "count": 2, "model": "claude-opus-4-6", "effort": "high" },
    { "count": 1, "model": "claude-opus-4-6", "context": "none" },
    { "name": "reviewer", "count": 1, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "prompt": "prompts/review.md" },
    { "name": "hunter", "count": 0, "model": "gpt-5.4", "driver": "codex-cli" },
    {
      "count": 3,
      "model": "openrouter/custom",
      "base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-or-..."
    }
  ],
  "post_process": {
    "prompt": "prompts/review.md",
    "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
    "max_idle": 2
  }
}
```

Credentials are driver-specific. Claude Code groups without `api_key`
use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from the environment;
see [Auth modes](USAGE.md#auth-modes) for other drivers. A named group
with omitted `count` or `count: 0` is an interactive-only profile.

**Per-group fields:** `name`, `model`, `count`, `effort`, `context`,
`prompt`, `auth`, `api_key`, `auth_token`, `base_url`, `tag`,
`driver`. See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for
field reference, environment variables, auth modes, context
modes, per-group prompts, and agent drivers.

## Drivers

Agent drivers decouple the harness from any specific CLI.
Each driver implements a fixed role interface:

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `agent_name` | Human-readable name (e.g. "Claude Code") |
| `agent_cmd` | CLI command (e.g. "claude") |
| `agent_version` | CLI version string |
| `agent_run` | Run one session, output JSONL |
| `agent_interactive_run` | Start the native interactive UI |
| `agent_settings` | Write agent-specific settings |
| `agent_extract_stats` | Parse session stats from log |
| `agent_detect_fatal` | Detect fatal errors from log + exit code |
| `agent_is_retriable` | Detect retriable errors (rate limits, overload) |
| `agent_activity_jq` | jq filter for activity display |

Built-in drivers: `claude-code` (default), `gemini-cli`,
`codex-cli`, `pi` ([Pi](https://pi.dev)), `fake` (test double).  See
[USAGE.md](USAGE.md#writing-a-new-driver) for the full interface
and guide to writing a new driver.

For Pi, set `"driver": "pi"` and use an Anthropic model ID or a Pi
`provider/model` ID. See [Pi setup and authentication](USAGE.md#pi).
